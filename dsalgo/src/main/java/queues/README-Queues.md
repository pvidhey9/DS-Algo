## Queues
* Queues are opposite of stacks in the way elements come out of the data structure.
* Think of Queue data structure has a queue of human beings lining up to pay a bill or vote
* Whoever stands in the queue first gets the opportunity to do their task and leave which is nothing but First In First Out (FIFO)
* Similar to stacks, addition and removal of elements/items is in constant time but accessing the Nth item is not

## Operations
* Operations are similar to that of a stack
* push()
* pop()
* poll() / peek()
* isEmpty()
